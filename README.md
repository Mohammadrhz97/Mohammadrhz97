- 👀 At 26 years old, I find myself with a diverse background. Since childhood, I've had a deep love for creation.
  Music, in particular, captured my imagination with its boundless creativity. Pursuing this passion, I enrolled at
  the University of Art, where I delved further into artistic expression. Along the way, I discovered unexpected
  sources of creativity, such as working as a barista for almost 8 years. Now, you might wonder why I transitioned
  to coding. For me, it was about finding an even larger canvas for my creativity. Just six months ago, I decided to
  learn coding to discover new ways to express my creativity. It's only been six months since I started,
  but I'm already excited about all the possibilities ahead.
